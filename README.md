# Random-Projects
### Random projects that I developed to improve my programming skills.
All of these programs were made in Kotlin or Python.

1. **Contact Book**: a simple program with the option of viewing a list of contacts, searching for a contact by name and adding a new contact to the contact list. The contact book is saved in a .txt file.

2. **Password Generator**: generates a very secure password with the option to contain uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and/or symbols. All of these options are customizable.
There are two versions of the program: one with prints on the console and the other in GUI with the tkinter module.

3. **Random functions**: only random functions with lists: creating, sorting and searching with lists.

4. **Tic Tac Toe**: the classic game in which the player plays against the computer. The game is printed on the console and drawn on Canvas.

5.  **Calculator**: simple calculator with buttons made with Tkinter in Python.
